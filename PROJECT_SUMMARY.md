## ✨ Key Features Showcase

### 1. Conditional Events (Unique Feature!)
The conditional events system is the standout feature that makes Dependa perfect for overthinkers:

**How it works:**
1. User creates a conditional event
2. Sets a trigger date and condition
3. Adds multiple todo items
4. System checks daily for triggered conditions
5. Automatically creates todos when condition is met

**Perfect for scenarios like:**
- "If project approved, then..."
- "If house sells, then..."
- "If budget approved, then..."
- "If test passes, then..."

### 2. Collaborative Features
- Multiple users can share a calendar
- Assign tasks to specific team members
- Everyone sees updates in real-time
- Daily email reminders for assigned tasks

### 3. Proof of Completion
- Upload evidence of completed tasks
- Images and documents supported
- View history of completed items
- Download proof files anytime
